Coding in function bigToSmall. function accept 1 parameter arr(2D number array).

Your task is: First to all, refer to the example above, flat output arr to a one-dimensional array.

And then sort array in descending order.

Finally, use the separator ">" to connect the elements into a string.

Don't complain about the situation like 1>1 is not reasonable, it is just a separator.


function bigToSmall(arr){
  let arr1 = [];
    for(let el of arr){
      arr1 = arr1.concat(el);
    }
  
  return arr1.sort((a, b) => b - a).join(">") ;
  
  
}
