Impliment the reverse function, which takes in input n and reverses it. For instance, reverse(123) should return 321. You should do this without converting the inputted number into a string.

function reverse(n){
  let num = 0;
  while (n > 0) {
    let last = n % 10;
    n = Math.floor(n / 10);
    num = num * 10 + last;
  }
  return num;
}
