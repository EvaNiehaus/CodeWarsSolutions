Task
Given an array of integers , Find the minimum sum which is obtained from summing each Two integers product .

Notes
Array/list will contain positives only .
Array/list will always has even size

function minSum(arr) {
  arr.sort((a, b) => a - b);
  let sum  = 0;
  for(let i = 0; i < arr.length / 2; i ++){
    sum = sum + arr[i] * arr[arr.length - 1 - i];
  }
  return sum;
}
