Given two integers a and b, which can be positive or negative, find the sum of all the integers between and including them and return it. If the two numbers are equal return a or b.

Note: a and b are not ordered!

function getSum( a,b ){
  let sum  = 0;
  if (a === b) return a;
    for (let i  = Math.min(a, b); i <= Math.max(a, b); i++) {
      sum = sum + i;
  }
  return sum;
}
