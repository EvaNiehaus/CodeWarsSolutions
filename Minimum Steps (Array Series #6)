Given an array of N integers, you have to find how many times you have to add up the smallest numbers in the array until their Sum becomes greater or equal to K.

function minimumSteps(numbers, value){
  let sum = 0;
  let i = 0;
  numbers.sort((a, b) => a - b);
  while(sum < value){
    sum  = sum + numbers[i];
    i++;
  }
  return i - 1;
}
