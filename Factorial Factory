In mathematics, the factorial of integer 'n' is written as 'n!'. It is equal to the product of n and every integer preceding it. For example: 5! = 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 = 120

Your mission is simple: write a function that takes an integer 'n' and returns 'n!'.

You are guaranteed an integer argument. For any values outside the positive range, return null, nil or None .

Note: 0! is always equal to 1. Negative values should return null;

function factorial (n) {
  let product = 1;
    for(i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      product *= i;
    }
  return n >= 0 ? product : null;
}
