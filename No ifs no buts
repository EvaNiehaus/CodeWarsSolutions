Write a function that accepts two parameters (a and b) and says whether a is smaller than, bigger than, or equal to b.

var noIfsNoButs = function (a,b) {
  switch(true) {
    case(a > b): return a + " is greater than " + b; 
    case(a < b): return a + " is smaller than " + b; 
    default: return a + " is equal to " + b  
  } 
}
