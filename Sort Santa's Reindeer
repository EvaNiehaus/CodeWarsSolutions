Sort Santa's Reindeer
Write a function that accepts a sequence of Reindeer names, and returns a sequence with the Reindeer names sorted by their last names.

Notes:
It's guaranteed that each string is composed of two words
In case of two identical last names, keep the original order

function compare(a, b){
  a = a.split(' ')[1];
  b = b.split(' ')[1];
  if(a >= b) return 1;
  else return -1;
   } 
  


function sortReindeer(reindeerNames) {
  return reindeerNames.sort(compare);
}
