Create a function that takes an integer argument of seconds and converts the value into a string describing how many hours and minutes comprise that many seconds.

Any remaining seconds left over are ignored.

Note:
The string output needs to be in the specific form - "X hour(s) and X minute(s)"

function toTime(seconds) {
let minutes = seconds / 60;
  return `${Math.floor(minutes / 60)} hour(s) and ${Math.floor((seconds/3600 - Math.floor(seconds / 3600)) * 60)} minute(s)`;
}
